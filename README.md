# Surfs_Up

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to retrieve more information from the hawaii.sqlite table on temperature trends for the month of June and December. 
The temperature data retrieved will be used to analyze whether a surf & ice cream shop is a good year round business model based on weather data. 

## Results
The temperature data results - 
- The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees, whereas in June it is 64 degrees.
- The average temperature in December is 71 degrees, whereas in June is is 74.9 degrees. 
- The maximum temperature in December is 83 degrees, whereas in June it is 85 degrees.
- The standard deviations for December and June are 3.75 and 3.25, respectively.

## Summary
The results are promising for the viability of an ice cream and surf shop in Hawaii with temperatures regularly above 74 degrees during December. However, further analyis to include January, as it is the coldest month in Hawaii is recommended. Data can be further analyzed to show the summary statistics by station (there are 9) and for precipitation. This data could shed insight to a better beach location for the surf & ice cream & surf shop as overall less rain and hotter temperatures are both desired weather conditions for this business model.
